29.229,30.95, Hello and welcome aboard the Battleship Pretension.
31.01,31.731,I'm Tyler Smith.
31.911,32.631,I'm David Back.
32.691,33.532,And thank you for listening.
33.592,33.912,David.
34.192,34.453,Yes.
34.533,36.374,How you doing?
36.414,39.676,"I'm in a really good mood, actually, other than being sick."
39.956,40.737,Yeah.
42.218,44.96,It's our two hundred and forty ninth episode.
45.12,45.26,Right.
46.44,71.393, even though we've just recorded our two hundred and fiftieth episode yes and you guys are in for a treat no it's gonna be it's always a lot of fun some some guests we've had on a couple times and people who've done our live shows but and it was a sort of raucous like fun it we don't worry we stuck to movies a lot a lot more than I expected
72.841,73.942, We didn't go very in-depth.
74.802,76.143,"No, but we did talk about movies."
78.264,79.864,And so it was a lot of fun.
79.904,86.107,"And so we wanted to do, I guess, for the lead-up to our two hundred and fifty episode, because we feel like it's kind of a milestone."
86.127,89.268,"I mean every fifty, every fifty episodes we treat like a milestone."
89.729,91.93,"But two hundred fifty seems like a, that's a big number."
91.95,92.23,Yeah.
92.25,93.75,"I mean we're halfway done, right?"
95.131,118.853, here's the thing like my first my first instincts like halfway done does that mean we're stopping at five hundred and then I realized like five hundred I hope we're done by then good lord no I would I would do this forever so I am I am I kind of want this to be this episode to be maybe a little more sentimental it may be a little more sentimental yeah because I am feeling kind of sentimental
120.839,130.966," It's funny, I'm thinking of things to say that I already said in episode two fifty, but that I want to... I don't want to... I can't reference them, obviously, because that'll go up next."
132.167,133.447,It's a weird thing about podcasting.
133.467,137.03,"You'd think under two hundred fifty episodes, I'd know how to do it without calling attention to it."
137.21,138.851,"We're through the looking glass, people."
141.553,149.558,"But what I was going to say is that twenty eleven... I still haven't landed on how I'm going to pronounce these years, by the way."
149.718,150.359,It's off-putting.
150.999,151.379, Which one?
153.26,153.82,The whole thing.
153.9,154.16,Okay.
154.18,155.8,Because sometimes I say the year of the mouse.
155.82,160.021,"I think I probably say that more often, but sometimes I say the year of the mouse."
160.181,161.882,I think I say the year of the mouse.
162.462,165.583,"Next year, I think I'm going to bump into the year of the mouse."
165.783,167.583,I'm going to say the year of the mouse.
168.043,171.304,"I don't know why, but the year of the mouse, I haven't picked it yet."
171.924,173.045,"Well, you know, I said the year of the mouse."
173.945,179.191, But I think the fact that eleven starts with a vowel and twenty ends with a vowel is weird.
179.492,180.974,So I like saying two thousand eleven.
180.994,182.936,So I have that hard stop.
183.337,184.458,"Anyway, this is not."
184.918,186.04,That's not what the episode's about.
186.46,186.621,Yeah.
188.911,215.113, twenty eleven has been a really good year for better pretension are are are best year yet but uh... hopefully not our best year uh... ever i think twenty twelve will be even better things are going well for us the uh... that we know we're still looking forward to them going going better but uh... i kinda wanted this to be like you said a little schmaltzy sappy sentimental episode
216.114,240.828, uh... not just about the year but about that that past two hundred and forty nine weeks of our lives uh... and this is very strange because i'll be honest with you it's usually me that kicks this kind of thing off i usually think of myself as the the one that is a bit more uh... sentimental and nostalgic and as you say schmaltzy and that sort of thing and so uh... for you to have uh... suggested this uh... was quite uh...
242.489,243.169," Well, off-putting."
244.129,245.59,"No, that's not true."
246.17,264.774,"It lines up, we really did start really bumping up the website and the written content and having other people and writing reviews and going to screenings and stuff right at the beginning of January."
265.114,267.475,So it's been this year that we've done it.
271.776,300.612, frankly it's when did we when we put the new site into effect though not right away no because the first reviews from when we started getting press screenings went up on the old side so I can't remember when that was if it was February and beam in early March the day around there the the website changed but nevertheless the effort started going in a little early I'm not even figure I was gonna say sorry what was that where was that going
301.311,302.313," What did I, what had I said?"
302.453,303.935,"You said it's been, it's been a year."
303.955,304.576,Mm-hmm.
304.757,305.558,It's been about a year.
305.658,309.564,"Oh yeah, and um, honestly it's, this year has..."
311.229,333.919, reinvigorated me about the about battleship retention not that I was like ready to throw in the towel or anything but there was a time I used to joke about it out during the podcast when I said I'm I am essentially just a personality I just I just would show up once a week and talk just an empty suit and you did most of the work for the podcast yeah
336.6,365.72, and we uh deciding to expand and do the website and stuff has really uh like i said reinvigorated me now you and i both do a lot of work as do um scott and kyle and uh daniel and matt and jack and josh and to some extent jason and charles and uh rudy a couple times uh when he when he deigns to throw something our way um
367.7,387.846, why do you hate Rudy I love Rudy when he condescends to send us something so like I said it's reinvigorated me about the podcast about my worth and maybe even future as a critic
390.498,403.546," I mean, I think there were times more than a year ago when I would sort of, if someone had referred to me as a film critic or like an internet critic because I do this podcast, I would like almost embarrassed, like say, oh no, I'm not a critic."
404.207,411.171,But now I really do think of myself that way because I'm writing reviews every week.
411.211,412.512,I'm seeing movies.
412.592,417.355,I'm probably thinking about movies even more in depth.
418.175,438.736, I mean this is the thing we talked about a few weeks ago just because we graduated film school doesn't mean either of us stopped learning about movies right we're still that's I mean that's part of the fun of doing this podcast is to still be engaged with movies and and to continue our education so again not only am I reinvigorated about battleship retention and about
440.31,441.85, who I am as a thinker about movies.
441.891,443.631,I'm pretty invigorated about movies in general.
446.032,448.352,"I mean, at this time last year, I was probably more into TV."
448.453,453.914,I think I'd said so on the podcast that I was watching more TV than movies.
454.774,457.395,And it's more even now.
457.575,462.197,I still watch a lot of TV because the medium calls for more time because
464.198,465.799, It's a series instead of just two hours.
467.059,471.062,But it's also – I don't mean to put this in any kind of negative way.
471.082,471.842,It's also easier.
471.862,472.943,I mean you are at home.
473.323,476.425,"And with a DVR, you don't have to be somewhere at a specific time."
476.445,477.766,You don't have to leave.
477.806,479.226,You don't have to put anything on.
480.807,486.231,So it's easier to maintain TV especially these days than movies.
487.111,493.814," So all this is to say that I'm in a really good place right now, so I'm probably gonna get hit by a bus or something."
497.396,504.119,"And I wanted to use this episode for us to, like I said, look back on not only the past year, but the past two hundred and forty-nine weeks."
504.519,504.919,Absolutely.
505.379,513.623,"How are you feeling right now, December nineteenth, twenty-eleven, about Battleship Retention, about movies, and about yourself?"
516.745,530.938," Well, that's uh, I mean the stuff that would go in a therapist's office You can leave in a fair you can go listen to Gilmartin's podcast to hear how I'm doing but no, it's uh, I Haven't listened to that by the way that episode."
531.218,532.179,No that podcast.
532.319,534.941,"Oh, you know what this episode?"
537.273,554.383, what nothing i just i was going to be snarky and i want to try and be positive on this episode once in two hundred and fifty episodes okay um of course you couldn't keep it up um but uh no i i
556.124,559.366," Okay, I won't sugarcoat."
560.186,566.089,"Listeners know and we've talked about on the show that this has been kind of a rough year for me for, as far as I can tell, no particular reason."
567.349,575.013,"I was dealing with, for the first time in my life, diagnosed depression and that was rough."
575.673,582.477,"And so, because, you know, it's, I hate to, and that's the other thing is you don't think that you personally have any"
583.617,595.841, views on depression you think oh and you know it's fine I have friends who suffer from depression it's not the end of the world and then someone says well you are this and then you're like oh shit but it becomes like the worst thing and
598.942,622.274," And the thing about doing this podcast in the midst, and I've written both on the More Than One Lesson website and Battleship Retention, I've written a couple of things that maybe were a bit too personal because I always tried to, well, on the BP side, I always tried to make it come back to film."
626.663,646.951," And what's astounding to me is that as tough as this year has been, and it's doing significantly better now due to any number of things, but as bad as the year has been for me personally, the worse it got, the more supportive the listeners were."
648.61,674.885," both for BP and More Than One Lesson, and even listeners when I was a guest on, you know, like I mentioned Gil Martin's show, when I was a guest on that show, you know, I got a, there were, alright, well, there were a couple of people here and there who, you know, the vibe on his show, it's a very good show, the vibe on his show is so generally up with people and, you know, you are not alone in trying to be encouraging and that's great, and then"
677.1,681.603," the minute I decide, and everyone talks about, hey, you know, whatever gets you through the day."
682.644,693.072,"Of course, if you say what gets you through the day is God, if you actually have the audacity to give it a name, well, then people will come and say, they can't snatch that hope away from you fast enough."
693.172,694.933,Even people who listen to that show?
695.253,695.854,"Oh, absolutely."
696.974,697.675," Oh, very much so."
698.555,699.836,"That is not Paul, by the way."
699.936,701.837,Paul was a perfect gentleman.
702.657,703.738,"Very, very encouraging."
704.038,705.238,But that's the thing.
705.319,705.979,That's some people.
706.099,708.04,"Other people were very, very complimentary."
708.76,710.961,"So all that is to say that, like,"
712.362,717.744," This show has, for me, meant a number of things since we started it."
718.684,732.808,"And in this last year especially, because the website has been growing and so our audience has been growing, but also we have developed relationships with our bloggers and the very fact that they are willing to"
734.266,758.994, do this for free i mean they they get you know they get to go to screenings for free and that's a get some dvds and blu-rays yeah and that's basically how we pay them yeah uh... but still like oh and people get to be rude to them on our website oh exactly oh yes that's the other thing and so the fact that that they're willing to do that like we got one guy by the way who is uh... he's combing the website for references to krzysztof kieślowski and
760.875,764.078," Man, that guy, that guy is a piece of work."
764.158,765.86,Thanks for keeping us honest about Kieslowski.
766.08,767.841,"Yeah, absolutely."
767.922,770.244,"Right, positive, positive."
771.144,771.665,It's fine.
771.985,781.634,"And so, and that's the thing is, the fact that people like him, because he's still, even that listener, or not listener, but that reader,"
783.015,791.58, even though his attitude is probably could be better he's still an informed person and still has very strong intelligent opinions about Kieslowski.
791.841,799.305,"And so the fact that we've gotten big enough to start to attract people that probably don't like us or agree with us, that's actually a good thing."
799.325,800.886,But that's neither here nor there.
800.906,807.77,So just the social element of podcasting has
808.951,825.187," It's always been there for me, but this last year, as I've really been going through some pretty rough shit, and to have the listeners and the readers email and tweet and Facebook comments,"
827.386,833.028," you know, encouragement and, you know, just compliments and stuff like that."
833.088,843.591,"Like, you know, admittedly, for a while, I certainly wasn't in any position to receive them, but that didn't stop anybody from putting it out there anyway."
843.671,847.772,"And so for me, this last year has been"
850.16,853.823," As negative as it has been, it has been incredibly positive."
853.843,872.135,"As I've been coming out of the depression haze in the last couple of months, I can look back on this year and realize that while it may have contained a great deal of personal failing on my part, I realize, oh my gosh, I am"
874.969,891.4, And I even have a hard time saying it I am like Loved by not merely friends and my wife and all that but I mean there are our listeners that have just been treated me literally like a like a close friend and and so that for me has been
893.061,916.996, has been this year and my and to bring it back around to kind of what you were saying in the last couple of months as I've kind of gotten out of this a little bit it's still there but just in more manageable form I have been reinvigorated by film and by podcasting and that's something that we've talked about a little bit is just like at the end of an episode for a while
918.417,920.058, I would just be looking forward to guest episodes.
920.078,926.722,"It's nothing against you, but, you know, it's just like, I don't want to listen to me and I assume no one else does."
927.122,938.349,"So I just want, I'll just try to get an interesting guest and hold my own with the guest, but really just have a showcase for this much more interesting person that someone might, would actually want to listen to."
940.39,947.655,"And as time, but as time has gone on, like whenever, you know, you and I talk for an hour and a half, two hours about"
948.155,951.178, about something like our episode last week.
951.238,956.202,"At the end of it, I'm just so invigorated by it and just like, oh, this is awesome."
956.242,957.684,I love thinking about movies like this.
959.445,961.867,And that has come about in this year as well.
961.888,963.829,I've kind of been re-energized in podcasting.
964.93,982.078," I don't write as much as the other guys, and I don't really go to as many screenings, partially because I've been kind of on and off working on a writing project on the side, but because I've been able to kind of scale back my work, I'm now able to do both."
982.778,987.32,So that's the long answer about this year.
987.34,992.202,"I will talk more about the show in general in a moment, but for me, that's what this year has been."
995.638,1005.416, let's I also want to talk about you know I should have looked up but when our first episode was March March of seven March of two thousand seven I don't know the exact date
1008.177,1012.28, I'm in a very different place in my life almost five years later.
1012.3,1015.662,Is that true of you?
1015.682,1017.464,"I mean, you're in the same place."
1018.564,1020.426,"In many ways, I'm in exactly the same place."
1020.506,1021.486,You're in the same apartment.
1023.047,1027.11,But there are some external circumstances that are different.
1031.514,1041.617," But from a personal standpoint, as far as relationships and just the direction my life has taken, I'm in a very different place, yes."
1042.233,1059.483, yeah i i was in two thousand seven we started i was living in a different apartment than i am now uh with a different girlfriend than i have now same cat same cat um uh same joie de vivre
1063.357,1066.92," No one would ever, ever apply that term to you."
1067.46,1069.441,I don't think that's true.
1069.601,1071.903,"I mean, I guess there are people who wouldn't understand what it meant."
1073.383,1075.565,There's always the misinformed.
1077.546,1085.13,But I was also working as an usher slash concession guy at a movie theater.
1085.15,1086.271,"The Arclight, nonetheless."
1086.771,1088.012,"But yeah, a movie theater."
1088.512,1089.353,"Now, look at me."
1089.393,1089.993,I'm wearing a tie.
1091.494,1104.285," Yeah, and they specifically did not have ties at the arc light now in that uniform and that bothers me It's weird cuz you got a shirt all the way up button the shirt all the way up no tie and no jacket Yeah, yeah, and the shirts are purple like it's a very eighties looking."
1104.805,1105.126,That was it.
1105.146,1105.646,They're purple.
1105.986,1107.808,They're blue Whatever.
1108.168,1110.89,"It's a deep blue, but they're blue a royal blue."
1110.971,1114.433,I would say I don't think it's that Vibrant all right.
1114.954,1119.318,"I think it is closer to a purple, but it's still blue They need to add ties to that thing is all I'm saying bow ties"
1119.943,1120.624, That's where you gotta go.
1121.104,1121.204,Ugh.
1122.285,1122.846,No thank you.
1122.946,1123.846,You don't like bow ties?
1123.966,1124.807,I hate bow ties.
1125.188,1125.968,"Oh, bow ties are great."
1126.228,1139.34,"Well, as you know, I've got a bit of a gut, and so for me, the tie is a way of, of course, a tie doesn't cover your gut, but it's a way of distracting, whereas a bow tie is like, hey everybody, look at this vast expanse of stomach."
1139.44,1142.242,"Yes, that's why you wear a vest with a bow tie."
1142.382,1142.763,Fair enough.
1143.303,1143.443, Yeah.
1143.804,1145.165,Vest goes with a bowtie.
1145.406,1146.527,You show a little less shirt.
1146.847,1147.148,Okay.
1148.469,1149.09,I read that somewhere.
1151.966,1159.05, And I was also still foolishly trying to work in production in movies.
1159.59,1160.51,I worked at the Arclight.
1161.091,1163.632,I worked for four days.
1164.472,1172.016,I quit my job at the Arclight in such a way that I couldn't come back to work on a movie that got canceled four days into development.
1173.757,1181.301,Then spent an interminable six months working as a PA at the worst place I've ever worked that I won't talk about here.
1182.182,1183.206, Not the hardest job I've ever had.
1183.506,1184.65,"One of the easiest, actually."
1184.87,1185.673,But still the worst.
1188.507,1193.732," Then I was closed captioning, then I was writing for Metromix, which was nice until they let me go."
1193.752,1195.753,"I was a freelance, and I was never hired by Metromix."
1195.833,1196.714,"Eh, that's not the point."
1197.955,1209.986,"Then I was working temp jobs, then I got an office job, now I got, almost a year ago, I got a new office job where I, you know, wear a tie, and can afford to wear a tie."
1214.429,1235.959, I honestly think and call them collared shirts man yeah it's no I in this economy I run all that down as a way of saying that my life has even even more than Tyler's changed quite a bit in the past five years and all for the better
1239.702,1245.127, And Battleship Retention has been a constant and has changed for me along with it.
1245.147,1249.23,"I mean, how many different places have we recorded, you know?"
1249.591,1250.131,"Weird, right?"
1250.311,1250.591,Yeah.
1252.513,1256.276,"But yeah, at a certain point we settled into here, which I'm glad about."
1256.437,1262.282,"I like that I can... I don't know how you feel about me coming to your house every week, but I like that it's not at my house."
1263.337,1291.811, uh... i like that it is that my house and uh... aside from the uh... in spite of fact i've known you at this point twelve years uh... i still will kind of scramble to clean up even though it's just you really uh... joking i clean up the bathroom specifically because that place is just a mess uh... places a train spotting mess but uh... at what i'm what i what i'm saying is that
1294.815,1303.528," I think a part of the, through all the changes, even though they've been changes for the best pretty much all along the way."
1306.604,1311.609," I've been doing Battleship Retention and caring about Battleship Retention for the most part, except for some fallow periods, like I talked about."
1312.37,1320.057,"And I think it has, it being a constant, and the listeners being a constant, and also the friends that we've made."
1320.097,1328.446,"You know, I mentioned Rudy, and of course, Ryan as well, from Criterion Cast, meeting them at Comic-Con, and some other people meeting the Slash Film guys."
1331.068,1351.108, uh at uh you know at at comic-con and being on their shows and being Dave when he came out here just like the the people that i've gotten to meet um has been a positive force uh in my life for five years um and and a constant so uh that's my schmaltzy stuff uh
1352.921,1372.707, okay i think i i i'll see you and uh... raise it uh... okay i probably won't raise it actually not your dad your circumstances are more dramatically change the mind but i do this is what i get into hell how bachelors has changed the way we watch movies that's fine and i want to do without mumbling okay i'm going to take a drink of water and uh... by the way uh...
1374.454,1375.754, Dave is sniffling a little bit.
1375.875,1376.775,He's not getting misty.
1377.555,1381.216,"He's just got my, he has what I assume is my cold from the last few weeks."
1381.416,1381.837,Possibly.
1381.857,1382.077,Yeah.
1382.417,1391.22,"Um, it's a, it started as a tickle in my throat this morning and I thought I woke up in my throat feeling like I had smoked a bunch of cigarettes last night, but I didn't."
1391.36,1392.16,When's the last time you smoked?
1392.5,1394.581,"No, I had a cigarette last night, but just one."
1394.601,1395.261,Okay.
1395.621,1399.903,"Um, and so I was like in the shower, I was like, what did I, why do I have this?"
1400.123,1402.724,"And then like on the drive to work, I was like, Oh, I know what this is."
1403.084,1404.025, Smoking is bad for me.
1404.165,1406.066,"Yeah, and then over the course of the day."
1406.146,1407.927,It's just it's just compiled.
1408.188,1413.411,"I hate that yeah, and I'm definitely sick I'm feeling a little woozy right now that kind of thing."
1414.032,1419.996,"I love the term woozy Yeah, because because it's because it is what it sounds like oh, yeah, all right."
1420.116,1420.216,Yeah
1422.824,1424.525, I'm trying to think of other words like that.
1425.706,1427.028,I can't.
1427.888,1443.522,If you remember the episode of the West Wing that Ian McShane was on when he was the delegate from Russia and he said that they want the president to wear a coat when he visits Russia because all the American presidents bound out of the car not wearing a coat in comparison.
1444.242,1448.446," The Russian president looks, and he's searching for the word, and Rob Lowe says, Frumpy?"
1449.066,1455.471,"And he's like, I don't know what that means, but onomatopoetically, it works."
1456.372,1462.297,"And Rob Lowe's like, you gotta love a guy who doesn't know frumpy, but knows onomatopoetically."
1463.157,1464.559,That's a good episode.
1464.579,1465.619,"It's one of my favorites, actually."
1466.58,1473.284," So, yeah, at the, I'll try to speak a little faster than I did a moment ago."
1473.324,1473.845,More than I did.
1474.845,1475.986,"Whatever, you know, it's fine."
1476.226,1479.648,"That's what this, by the way, everyone, this episode is this."
1480.869,1483.05,"Alright, so if you don't like it, you're done."
1483.09,1487.833,But we are kind of following the format where the first part we're talking about not movie stuff.
1488.254,1488.434,Right.
1489.314,1493.537,And then we're gonna get into movies and the movies we've seen over the past five years and stuff like that.
1493.757,1496.498," I mean, hey, some people enjoy the personal stuff."
1496.538,1498.418,"By some people, I mean one person, Steph Smith."
1498.439,1500.859,"Thanks, Steph."
1501.359,1502.72,And maybe friends of ours.
1503.28,1503.86,"Yeah, you know what?"
1503.9,1506.041,I mentioned all the people I met at Comic-Con.
1506.061,1515.384,"I didn't mention Steph, whom I met for the first time this year at Comic-Con and had a drink at Fred's Mexican Cafe."
1515.404,1517.505,I wish I could have gone to Comic-Con.
1517.525,1518.125,Stupid Josh.
1519.205,1522.508," Anyway, I'm Josh dumb old Josh getting married."
1522.889,1540.085,"Yeah that dumb weekend so um Anyway, I'm not gonna say it on the podcast but taking away his fiance's awesome last name that I love to say You can still say it Whitsky there's no H in there though Yeah, it's wh it"
1541.952,1542.873, I see it that way.
1543.113,1543.994,"Oh, okay, fair enough."
1544.234,1545.015,Don't take this from me.
1545.035,1545.595,"Okay, I'm sorry."
1545.635,1546.676,It's all I've got.
1546.756,1547.257,"Oh, really?"
1547.357,1548.398,"Oh, wow, you're changing your tune."
1549.819,1559.027,"Yeah, so for me, yeah, I came out here and you worked at a movie theater, I worked at a Blockbuster, and after several months of working there, after"
1560.228,1563.149, And I had been there at that point with the company for several years.
1564.209,1566.77,I talked it over with my wife and I quit with nothing ready.
1567.73,1569.691,I quit with no other jobs ready.
1570.231,1573.612,"And that is, by the way, a testament to how awesome my wife is that she was okay with that."
1573.672,1579.914,I was about to say that we might not still be doing the show if Jenny weren't such an awesome wife.
1580.234,1582.455,"Oh, that's a big part of it too, yes."
1583.115,1583.815,She's part of the family.
1584.315,1591.82," Yeah, and now of course, I don't say her name very often because I don't know why but my girlfriend's name is Natalie and she's pretty cool too."
1592.04,1607.17,"She is wonderfully supportive and especially, you know, this year the screenings and the live shows and all the time that I have spent on evenings not with her has never elicited a single complaint."
1607.411,1610.433,"Nothing but, you know, the support."
1610.673,1613.955,"You should do your thing for your podcast, for your website."
1615.556,1616.496, all sorts of awesome stuff.
1616.876,1618.957,She also came up with the name for my other podcast.
1618.977,1619.898,I don't know if I've ever said that.
1620.238,1620.818,"Oh, I didn't know that."
1620.838,1622.479,"Previously on, that was Natalie's idea."
1622.579,1623.079,That's a good name.
1623.299,1625.8,"Yeah, I agree."
1626.54,1638.566,"So yeah, so for a while I was unemployed and then I started, and that's the thing, I came out here with dreams of screenwriting, forgetting of course that I'm a deeply undisciplined writer who, by the way, is not very good at coming up with plot."
1639.526,1643.549, I come up with characters that are very strong and don't have anything to do with them.
1644.23,1648.773,"And so, and then I don't usually realize until at, oh, fifty pages in, and I'm just like, damn it."
1650.12,1651.321," Yeah, this isn't going anywhere."
1653.922,1658.665,"But yeah, so I came out here for that and I started interning."
1658.825,1664.828,"I interned at one production company, discovered I was not at all to my surprise, by the way, a terrible intern."
1666.569,1667.309,Very good typist.
1668.21,1671.992,And I started covering scripts and then I interned at another place.
1672.032,1676.054,I was slightly better there because I was doing a lot more script coverage and that kind of thing.
1676.954,1686.96," Uh, and then I quit that and started working at the worst job I've ever worked at, which was at a post-production house."
1687.72,1694.584,"Um, and that was bad because not only was I, well, first off the job that I was hired for, I would be very good at the job that it became."
1694.604,1699.567,"I was not good at, uh, as a little frustrating, a little bait bait and switch there for old Tyler."
1699.587,1701.968,"Um, but, uh,"
1704.298,1731.998, but throughout these crappy jobs uh... battleship retention was a constant and it was the thing that really kept me going and and uh... and what's more is uh... i will refrain from getting uh... to christian about it but uh... in about august of a late uh... i really i was in the throes of this terrible uh... post-production job and um... i was uh... just really really demoralized
1732.558,1742.187, And I started getting the feeling that as far as the calling for my life and the direction my life was going to take should maybe head more in the direction of film criticism.
1742.788,1747.272,"And my first reaction was, why on earth would God ever call somebody to be a film critic?"
1747.352,1748.093,Nobody likes them.
1749.394,1755.0,And there's no way God could ever do anything with a film critic.
1755.46,1757.142,"Look, we've all read the Teddy Roosevelt quote."
1757.682,1760.244," all right, about that's not the critic who matters, all right?"
1760.544,1761.866,We've all seen Ratatouille.
1762.166,1763.347,We all know Anton Ego.
1764.127,1766.89,"Many of us saw Lady in the Water, and I'm sure we all regret it."
1767.61,1769.232,We know how the world views critics.
1769.892,1776.738,"And so for me, from a spiritual standpoint, to think, why on earth would God ever call someone to be a critic?"
1777.739,1784.965,"But then I finally kind of gave myself over to the idea of it, and it has paid off in spades for me because"
1786.803,1800.534," being able to talk about movies from the outside, and we've talked about this before, recently, the way critics watch movies as opposed to the way people who make movies watch movies."
1801.015,1806.92,"And when I finally, I'll say the word, I was reluctant to say it for a long time, when I finally gave up"
1807.984,1829.911," on the idea of being a writer, and moved to the idea of being a critic, I don't know, when I finally moved over, there was such freedom in being able to talk about movies however I wanted."
1831.687,1844.513," And so as I finally gave myself over to it, it was exciting, it was freeing, and the way in which we could have the conversation changed."
1845.354,1857.2,"And sure, I was always a little prickly about the idea of people bashing critics, and there's still plenty of people online who say like, critics, what do they know?"
1858.28,1887.869, they're just they're just standing in judgment of film you know they've never made a movie and incidentally I do I did have this thought the other day chances are when people say that it's because a critic has bashed a movie they love and they say like they've never made a movie what do they know it's like well you never made a movie so what do you know yeah just because that's the thing just because you're coming down in favor of the film doesn't mean you're not judging it you're judging it positively I'm judging it negatively I think yeah not having made a movie is actually probably a good thing for criticism
1888.149,1912.291, oh i think i think so and it's uh... but it's one of those things like it because movies aren't made for people who make movies they're made for people who watch movies right and i agree i agree fully but also it's that idea like let's say uh... we liked uh... no country for old men which we both did and then i talked to somebody who uh... just somebody who doesn't like those kind of movies and they're like oh that movie sucked do i say
1913.154,1937.76, you've never made a movie so what do you know no i don't it's people only ever say it to critics because critics put themselves out there as people who know more on the front lines were on the front lines especially on the internet and so uh... so yeah and that's that's the other thing is everything all right they're not getting reception okay well why do you need it uh... texan my girlfriend okay uh...
1942.731,1943.616, Is this distracting you?
1943.878,1944.119,Yes.
1944.582,1944.923,Go ahead.
1945.265,1945.849,Let me ask you this.
1945.909,1946.432,If I did this.
1948.177,1976.652, well i was talking yeah look i could talk a right through it all right fair enough you know i i don't have a show by the way i'm doing the show for the listeners all right we're not going to set up a fair enough gold so the last thing that i'll say is that uh... as everyone knows i'm very very neurotic uh... i'd never thought of myself that way but is become clear pretty quick uh... that that's what i am i don't necessarily like it i'm trying to fight against it but there we go
1977.752,1984.358," And as far as like, I talked about some of the personal changes."
1985.318,1996.407,"I still have issues with myself as a critic, as I wrote a fairly long blog talking about like this constant worry of being a fraud because I haven't seen this movie or that movie or whatever."
1998.129,2006.095,"But to go back to what I was saying a moment ago, when you and I talk for an hour about something that could not be more academic,"
2008.132,2014.259," It is so much fun, and by the way, in that moment, that is where I get any confidence I have in life."
2015.245,2017.866, I think I'm a pretty good husband.
2018.107,2019.387,That's probably as far as I'll go.
2019.968,2022.209,"As a friend, I'm deeply flawed."
2024.25,2027.252,"And as I said, as a writer, I'm undisciplined."
2027.712,2031.874,"Pretty much every element of my life, it's like, okay, I'd give myself a C plus, B minus."
2033.635,2039.959,"And again, when it comes to certain aspects of criticism, I still go B, B minus."
2040.859,2048.443," But when it comes to the ability to talk, but what's more is just the excitement in talking and knowing that I genuinely love movies."
2048.703,2050.784,"When people say, ah, critics, they don't like anything."
2051.245,2051.745,Fuck you.
2052.225,2053.066,I love movies.
2053.646,2056.367,And you love- Even positive?
2056.428,2057.248,This is positive.
2058.649,2059.389,What do you think of that?
2061.05,2064.012,"Just, you know, I love movies and you love movies."
2064.112,2065.773,And that's really what it's about.
2066.827,2076.43," And the more I embrace what Battleship Pretension is, the more I realize, much to my surprise, this isn't about me."
2076.49,2081.151,"We both have personalities, we both have tastes, and the way we express it is a big part of the show."
2081.551,2082.852,But it's not about me.
2082.892,2083.592,It's not about you.
2083.692,2085.152,It's about films.
2085.712,2091.154,"And if what you, the listener, get out of this is a new movie that you've never heard about,"
2091.574,2119.278, or if we make you rethink a movie you've already seen then we've done our jobs and it doesn't matter if i've seen this movie or that movie i'll get to it but like in that moment this show has given me that level of confidence and it's a confidence i lack in almost every other element of my life but also i want to go back to the idea that you and i are constantly learning and also the thing you brought up the social aspect of being on the internet uh...
2119.878,2142.916, cuz it's yeah it does feel good to like writing the recommendations and something in here back like i watched this because you mentioned the show that does feel good but the same time uh... i've gotten you know uh... emails or or or or comments on the on the blogs that mention movies and it's a it's a it's a given take it's it's it's a back-and-forth with the people who are interested in having conversations by the way
2143.696,2150.763," There are always people who are gonna write reviews or comments who are not interested in conversations They're just interested in being mean for no reason, right?"
2152.965,2161.292,"Which is a fairly new idea on the internet, I think I think I think it started with our website And I'm not talking about just someone who disagrees with disagrees with us, right?"
2161.412,2164.975,I love someone there's currently a wonderful conversation
2166.096,2167.016, about Mel Gibson.
2167.216,2173.478,Yeah that thing has been going on forever and I keep meaning to like jump back in but it's buried so deep on the website.
2173.518,2186.862,Yeah and it's and it's and it's great it's two people who as far as I can tell disagree a lot about certain things but there is a respect there and that's okay
2188.143,2192.145," Years ago, okay, this is going to be really dumb and people are going to make fun of me for it."
2192.445,2193.586,"Okay, I look forward to it."
2194.126,2208.074,"But I think I've told you this before, that I had this kind of dumb notion that through Battleship Pretension, we could at least start to change the nature of online film criticism."
2210.089,2211.872, which is specifically the tone.
2212.713,2224.05,"And even though I did just say fuck you to people, the tone is, it's actually possible for both of us to be right."
2225.089,2227.991," in our opinion about the film, in our reaction to the film."
2228.351,2232.614,There are plenty of facts about a film that one of us can be wrong on.
2232.694,2235.615,But we both have our points of view.
2236.136,2240.639,"But do you think you thinking we could change film criticism, maybe you were just like,"
2241.659,2244.282, not aware of the breadth of film criticism on the internet?
2244.342,2245.042,It was probably that.
2245.062,2247.204,There already was actually a lot of good stuff going on.
2247.444,2248.806,"There already was, absolutely."
2251.148,2258.754,"And so that's why I look back, I see it as idealism, but I also realize that... The internet is better for us, being on it."
2259.495,2260.396,That goes without saying.
2260.736,2261.016,Sure.
2261.377,2264.039,We have raised the general quality.
2264.059,2264.66,Yeah.
2265.41,2268.493," I mean, between the two of us, we have three podcasts."
2268.533,2270.935,We are quite an entity.
2271.315,2275.298,"I mean, two of those podcasts are good, but which one am I talking about?"
2275.638,2276.039,I don't know.
2276.059,2279.081,You're talking about More Than One Lesson and Previously On.
2279.882,2284.706,"Yeah, I'd say that's about right, but they haven't been going as long as this, so I can't say this about those."
2287.068,2294.173,"So, yeah, and so when I read, at the very least, I don't think we've changed anything at all."
2295.549,2320.794," When I do read those comments about Mel Gibson going back and forth, intelligent, respectful comments by people who disagree, I'm excited that while we certainly didn't change anything, we at least are giving people a forum in which to do that and in which we, hopefully through the show and also through the blogs themselves, encourage people to think"
2323.886,2330.692," not necessarily better, but deeper about film and deeper about other film lovers."
2331.533,2339.0,"Because the internet, whether it be about film or TV or really anything, there's a competition there."
2339.24,2346.067,"And what I hope we try to get across is the idea of, you don't have to compete with anybody."
2346.627,2346.807, Mm-hmm.
2347.047,2360.57,"You know, you can actually what here's the thing if somebody says something that you don't agree with or something How about this something you didn't know now, you know it you don't have to trump them with what you know that they don't it's more about a conversation than about Being right or wrong."
2360.67,2361.09,Exactly.
2361.41,2364.45,It doesn't sound like who's that Armand white Dewey.
2364.65,2364.81,Yeah.
2365.23,2368.191,"Yeah, but he's he's right about that bound to happen sooner."
2368.211,2371.091,Yeah I want to take a timeout to talk about Armand.
2371.111,2373.612,I'm gonna shut this door go and
2375.968,2386.644, uh... another another guy that i almost or open even i don't know that much about him christopher hitchens who died recently uh... i think
2389.928,2393.453," I think a lot of people are worth listening to, even if you disagree with a lot of what they say."
2394.754,2402.684,"There's a lot about Christopher Hitchens that rubbed me the wrong way, and there's a little about Armand White that rubs me the wrong way."
2403.585,2406.328,"But I also think, in defense of Armand White,"
2407.586,2427.199, uh... it's not a sentence that said very often no but i i think if you read his reviews regularly uh... and not just the ones where he disagrees with the movie that you liked uh... like a lot of people do there is a consistency to his approach very much so uh... i think that's all i thought i don't want to make this episode about that but uh...
2429.04,2445.449," I disagree with him a lot, and I do think he has some contrarian tendencies, much like Christopher Hitchens did, where he sometimes buries the power of his actual opinion and statement by overstating things for a fact."
2445.509,2448.011,I think that's a fault that he and Christopher Hitchens both share.
2448.691,2455.255,But I do think he's a critic that's worth reading because he's thinking about film in a way that a lot of people aren't.
2456.275,2480.334, it very much so and i don't think i i agree i think he's got some contrarian attitudes which i think probably many of us do i think a lot of critics probably do but uh... i don't know what you're talking about not me so uh... but uh... yeah when you when you read his stuff like sometimes it's outrageous sometimes like jack and jill for example can't possibly have all this
2481.196,2487.978, But he's willing to entertain that it does and the very fact that he's willing to give some films a certain look a second look
2489.907,2513.156, shows a certain there's something kind of admirable about that even even though again yes i disagree with him almost all the time but the very i think he legitimately does look at film a different way now the fact that he knows it's a different way and that that different way bothers people i think he and sometimes he can be obtuse about the fact that he's looking at film a different way yeah than other people
2513.556,2537.513, yeah and it could be he can be a bit hypocritical on the one hand talking about how uh the internet uh film criticism can be a form for discussion and then him being purposefully obtuse about other people's in fact most people's uh criteria for what makes a good film right that is kind of that is kind of a problem yeah and so he so it is it he can be very frustrating but the idea that he is willing to
2538.334,2546.079," look at it from another point of view that, by the way, will get him labeled any number of things, and that he's willing to do that."
2546.119,2553.343,"Now, he might draw energy from that almost to a fault, but it's not necessarily the worst instinct."
2554.728,2579.484, uh... let's get back to uh... i'm glad i'm glad you you get to talk about movies for awhile there in in the in the abstract uh... which i like that's kind of what we do uh... but i want about that specific maybe some specific movies are just specific ways that i watch movies differently but also a difference of or or be a further understanding of what film criticism is even though i said at the beginning that i feel more like a critic now because i write reviews
2581.125,2588.208," These academic conversations that you're talking about, that's criticism too, I think."
2589.148,2591.909,It's not just about reviewing individual movies.
2591.989,2593.77,"It's about, I guess,"
2595.839,2597.06, talking about movies as a whole.
2597.14,2609.065,"But I also feel like as the podcast has progressed, we've done a lot more of the academic topics and a lot fewer of the, basically the topics which are fun to do, but which often turn into just like a list."
2609.445,2612.927,"It might as well be like a top ten or something, but we just didn't number it, you know."
2613.527,2614.147,And those are fun.
2614.307,2618.329,We do just like good death scenes is one we always go back to.
2618.349,2620.57,"Awesome death scenes, I believe is what we call it."
2621.19,2622.311, We don't really do a lot of those anymore.
2622.391,2623.052,Maybe we should.
2623.072,2625.014,Maybe we are taking ourselves a bit too seriously.
2625.034,2625.935,Yeah.
2626.275,2629.918,"Here at two and forty, two hundred and forty episodes might be a good time for self-reflection."
2633.802,2637.486,But I worry that I'm that
2641.368,2654.713," I'm trying to get across is that I'm thankful for what the podcast has done for me and the listeners and everything, but I'm worried that you and I are coming across as tuning our own horns about how great we are compared to where we were five years ago."
2656.154,2659.155,"I know that's not what either of us mean, but I'm just..."
2659.875,2688.278, worried about that well okay let me try to diffuse your uh... your worry and i am in a i'm in a different certainly in a different place uh... as far as my my circumstances i have a job that i love it has nothing to do with film and i i i but i just wanted then as far as the show itself like even though i do have a great deal more confidence in the way that i speak i still have such a long way way to go not merely in what i see but i read with every new film i see
2689.759,2710.891, that is great i'm reminded of just how much i didn't know like it's each each film is yeah and i'm gonna sound really cheesy each film is a gateway to my own ignorance um but i don't want to sound like we're saying like uh we stunk as podcasters and critics five years ago and now we're great thanks for coming along with us we're
2711.511,2713.172," I think we're better, I think I can say that."
2714.453,2723.897,But there's still a lot of people who are a lot better than we are out there in both podcasting and writing on the internet and writing in print.
2725.558,2727.939,And probably on the radio somewhere too.
2728.139,2729.06,People still doing that?
2729.22,2729.66,The radio?
2729.9,2730.44,"I don't know, maybe."
2730.46,2731.041,I don't know.
2731.961,2733.742,"Henry Rollins, he's got a show."
2733.802,2736.143,I saw him the other day on Ventura Boulevard.
2736.163,2739.225,He was sitting outside a Starbucks with his laptop on a surprisingly cold night.
2739.884,2763.244, yeah so you go say hi no i didn't realize it was him right away because i do not think of henry rollins is having like platinum white hair yeah i saw a picture from recently that someone like he was at a walmart in kentucky and it's like uh someone posted the picture online like hey i met henry rollins but you know what i'll bet he's a nice guy if you went up to him oh i don't think that's super nice to you yeah i don't doubt it
2767.108,2791.468, in this if i can go a little off topic but in this world that we and i think a lot of people who listen to us live in this internet world where you have to sort of uh... create your own thing make your thing is the thing that jesse thorne says for the show uh... uh... henry ron's kind of is a role model even though he's not part of his like an internet guy he is a guy who like defined his
2793.044,2801.327," I'm sure he would not be happy if I called it a brand, but defined himself and then did what he wanted and got people to come along with him."
2802.347,2804.568,And it's not necessarily a cult of personality either.
2804.668,2810.269,It's just like he puts in the work to make interesting stuff and he cares about the stuff that he does.
2810.289,2814.431,"Henry Rollins is a role model, I think."
2815.231,2816.312, A lot of people should look up to him.
2816.352,2827.477,"And listen to, if his syndicated music show airs on a public station near you, here it's on, I think, Saturday nights, eight to ten p.m."
2827.917,2828.557,It's great stuff.
2829.418,2835.481,And he doesn't just play a block of music and then count back the songs.
2835.521,2839.983,He stops between each song and tells a story about the song and the band.
2841.624,2842.384,He's awesome.
2843.024,2843.985,I think Henry Knowles is great.
2845.538,2846.118, Let's try to get him.
2846.759,2848.66,"Sure, yeah."
2848.7,2849.481,Bring his own microphone.
2849.501,2851.102,"I don't know if you know, that's a thing he does."
2851.362,2851.863,"Oh, I didn't know."
2851.883,2857.407,"When he does his sort of tours of like spoken word stuff, he has his own microphone that he brings."
2858.107,2858.928,I don't like that at all.
2860.249,2860.489,Yeah.
2860.969,2861.67,What's wrong with my mic?
2862.952,2879.071, all right so let's let's talk about movies specifically because there's the first episode and I'll bet any podcaster has the same experience the first episode you do you end up trashing
2879.761,2902.005," Yeah, that's been it was my experience on both the podcasts that I have done and the first one we recorded Which we ended up trying to I don't think it exists anymore if it does No, it doesn't because it would be on my ex-girlfriend's computer and I think that computer crashed and everything is lost with it There is I believe a five minute clip from it available on our old myspace page, which I never bothered taking down"
2903.826,2928.298, uh... and i guess we're just doing this because it was a trial run we decided even though it was march two thousand seven well i guess that is kind of our and now to talk about our favorite movies in two thousand six and uh... and i look back at that list of movies now uh... which has of course change could have seen some more movies uh... from that year but uh...
2929.458,2956.958, I was looking at the other day just trying to remember what I had to say about it and I think I know I just again I still have a long way to go but I have a lot I could talk about film a lot more intelligently or maybe just more confidently is the thing because I remember talking about how one of my top ten films of two thousand six was Borat and that's still true that still holds true it is one of my top ten films but I remember not being able to articulate and us like laughing about it that's another thing
2957.859,2963.723," Early podcasts, a lot of hosts laughing at each other, which of course we still do, but we're funny now."
2964.123,2969.166,"But, um... Oh, good, yes, that'll... I'm sure that'll... people will be fine with that statement."
2969.506,2972.488,"I mean, I should put up disclaimers like, here I'm being sarcastic."
2972.508,2976.01,"When I say the internet is better because of us, that's false bravado."
2976.79,2980.492,"When I say that we are hilarious, false bravado."
2980.913,2981.993,"You're still pretty funny, I mean..."
2984.375,2989.297," But I think we have gotten maybe more aware that we're doing this for the listeners, not just for each other."
2989.857,2991.217,"Anyway, we're getting off topic."
2993.558,3001.122,"You know, but now I can think about Borat and think about why..."
3003.248,3026.465, well you know why I love it so much it's not just that it is very funny which it is but it's that it uses comedy to disarm in a very real way and make points that an audience might not be receptive to if they weren't weren't laughing about them which is that thing that good a lot of good good comedy does but also just
3028.763,3056.296, uh... in terms of structure and form uh... and in in terms of uh... such bearing bear sasha baron cohen's uh... personality the sort of like uh... gonzo journalistic uh... type of approach to uh... to borad and uh... less so to bruno which was bruno one of my favorite films of that year bruno one of my least favorite films of that year uh...
3057.857,3085.835, not really looking forward to the dictator but anyway all that that I just stumbled through I couldn't have even said that five years ago even though I'd been to film school yeah you know in film school you maybe you write about movies but unless you don't you're not forced to talk about them and you're not forced to write I don't know I guess I
3087.654,3094.337," In film school, to a certain extent, you are learning, but you're writing, to a certain extent, for the teacher, for the grade."
3097.298,3102.26,And I care more what the listeners think of me than I do what my teachers thought of me.
3103.2,3112.504,"So I actually want to be, not necessarily right, but I want to be interesting or insightful about a movie."
3112.564,3116.125,"I guess I want to be right, but I don't want to say that there is a right or wrong when you're talking about movies."
3120.813,3124.977, And I don't know that I I definitely didn't have that five years ago.
3125.357,3137.466,I remember back in school I was taking a silent comedy class and I wound up and we wound up wound up having to write pretty long papers about
3139.304,3153.803," Chaplin, Keaton, Lloyd, and then we were going to do one about Langdon, but due to various class cancellations due to weather, we wound up only seeing one of his films and weren't really in a position to write a long paper about the one film we saw."
3157.315,3163.843," But I remember writing a paper about Chaplin, about his socialist tendencies in his films."
3164.583,3167.827,And I wrote the paper because I knew I could.
3167.847,3169.75,I knew there was plenty there.
3172.393,3174.855,But I did not believe Chaplin to be a socialist.
3175.997,3181.881," Like, it's definitely there, don't get me wrong, like those, some of those themes are there, but I don't believe them."
3183.062,3187.766,"Which is, I don't believe that he would call himself a socialist or a communist or anything like that."
3189.127,3192.748," But it was not an easy paper to write, but there's plenty there."
3193.328,3197.509,So I wrote a paper that was good.
3197.549,3198.31,It got a good grade.
3198.55,3199.89,But intellectually dishonest?
3200.21,3200.39,Yeah.
3201.231,3202.451,And I did it because I could.
3202.471,3202.871,Right.
3203.091,3213.834,"And then thankfully, even just from Chaplin to Keaton, and then from Keaton to Lloyd, I started to change the way I wrote papers."
3213.854,3216.415,"And I realized, I'm going to write what I want to write."
3218.397,3223.703, I think there's something left over from the high school mentality of just do what you need to do.
3225.683,3250.64, yeah to let us to move on that's our high school mentality plenty of people did do great work in high school absent no absolutely uh... but uh... and so when i when it came time for me to talk about keaton and i talked all about his obsession with uh... mechanism and that was something that i did believe very fervently and the more and what's more and this is something that i think his has happen even more so because we are required
3251.621,3261.151," by nobody, by the way, except ourselves, to talk movies for at least an hour every week in hopefully an intelligent way."
3261.191,3263.554,The very fact that there is an audience holds you accountable.
3267.358,3273.084,I discovered that the more you believe something or the more you're personally invested in
3274.685,3279.908," Some people would say that the more you're personally invested in it, the more defensive you're going to get of your own attitude."
3280.868,3283.07,And I think that is true a little bit.
3283.91,3285.111,It's a risky run.
3285.491,3285.991,Very much so.
3286.051,3287.752,"It's a slippery slope, David."
3288.573,3301.12,"But what is much, maybe not more likely, but something that is as likely to happen is that the more invested you are, the more interested you are in seeing how deep this goes."
3302.085,3303.91, this this theory you might have.
3303.93,3304.832,And so.
3308.34,3314.245," as you explore it further, you may find that it kind of makes a right turn."
3314.445,3321.472,"And the more committed you are to that, the more willing you are to make that right turn and say, I was wrong initially."
3321.872,3322.733,Let's see where we go.
3323.053,3331.881,"And so when I first came up with this idea, it's like, you know, man, this chaplain, this Buster Keaton sure is fascinated with experimenting with the camera."
3332.461,3333.322, That's really something.
3333.522,3335.684,"And then it's like, I think I could write a paper about that."
3336.064,3337.125,"Okay, well, what does that mean?"
3337.665,3338.686,Experimenting with the camera?
3338.706,3340.427,"I mean, that also means experimenting with editing."
3341.068,3346.372,"And then just like, it's weird that a comedian would be so fascinated with just the mechanism of filmmaking."
3347.247,3352.633," But wait a minute, he's fascinated with mechanism all the time, of everything, like his obsession with trains in the general."
3352.713,3358.899,"And like, like the more I thought about it, the more it's like, holy shit, this goes, this rabbit hole goes deep."
3359.84,3365.366,"And, uh, and so it's, and that's, and there's the exhilaration that we're talking about."
3366.147,3369.811,"Uh, if you're willing to go down this path,"
3373.132,3387.403," completely and with as much of an open mind as possible, I think it's so much more exciting and it's so liberating than to just say, uh, Keaton likes machines."
3388.403,3389.124,That's all I got.
3389.604,3392.446, And doing the podcast has helped you to explore that further.
3392.687,3393.427,"Oh, absolutely."
3393.467,3399.612,"I mean, there are times now where, and again, like you said, I don't want to make it seem like I've got it all worked out now."
3399.752,3403.034,I still have moments of stubbornness and being defensive.
3403.054,3405.076,I don't think I would have liked Tree of Life
3412.04,3413.721, had it come out four or five years ago.
3414.181,3414.421,Really?
3414.441,3416.663,"I mean, I think I would have appreciated it."
3416.903,3422.746,"But I mean, you know, we talk about my general dislike of Mulholland Drive."
3423.006,3423.567,When you first saw it?
3423.587,3424.367,When I first saw it.
3424.627,3425.888,I have an appreciation for it now.
3425.928,3427.489,And I would say I'd probably even like it now.
3428.47,3430.551,"Whereas Tree of Life, I loved it"
3432.222,3433.605, from frame one till the end.
3433.785,3440.979,"And I was and I happened to see it with a group of people that they liked it, they appreciated it, but they're just like, they also like had a lot of problems with it."
3440.999,3442.361,And there's nothing wrong with having problems with it.
3442.882,3443.043,But
3444.577,3472.421, the somehow they're their problems as far as what they're able to figure out not figure out by the way i don't have to have life figured out but um... but the very fact that they that it could that it's a hard film to characterize one way or the other that was seen as a flaw for them and i think in the early days of this podcast i probably was probably a similar way this time has gone on just talking with you and and talking with
3472.941,3500.765, other guests and and being a guest on other podcasts which that again requires you to bring just really listen to somebody else's point of view uh... i think i think that the way advice to people who have apparently to a podcast give that podcast listen first give it a shot i think we may be uh... i think our first time on the slash film cast we probably could have uh... and a little bit more genial
3501.465,3503.647, or just aware of what they were doing at that time.
3503.707,3526.005,"They were so nice to ask us on and I think we were, we kind of like had blinders on to, at that point we still had blinders on to the fact that there was this whole internet film blogging podcasting community and so I think I was completely unaware that they had like so many more listeners that were like well known or what slashfilm.com was and I was just like, oh yeah, I'm going on another podcast."
3526.025,3528.047,I don't think I was mean but I think
3530.41,3531.87, I knew they were bigger than us.
3532.09,3541.433,"I think I knew that, too, because, yeah, but we definitely... Were you saying there was a bit of a swagger to the way that we were approaching the whole situation?"
3541.453,3541.953,But the wrong kind.
3541.973,3546.414,"I think I still have a swagger when I go on other people's podcasts, because that's the dumb persona, I guess, that I have."
3548.215,3554.777,But there are times that I think we could have... I wish we could have a do-over on the State of Play episode of this last podcast.
3554.797,3555.057,That's fine.
3555.077,3555.957,That movie's not very good.
3556.477,3559.758," Yeah, I would still stick by the idea that that movie is not good."
3560.018,3560.778,Yeah.
3560.999,3561.679,Didn't care for it.
3562.739,3562.999,Anyway.
3563.719,3566.26,"And, okay, all right, the idea of sticking by something."
3566.34,3568.821,"Okay, I stick by the fact that I think Avatar is not very good."
3569.821,3575.543,"I stick by the fact that I think Kids Are Alright is awful, with the exception of some performances."
3575.943,3577.424,And I know that even just saying awful
3578.942,3582.924," probably caused a little something in you, and maybe a little something in the listener."
3583.004,3589.127,Because I believe that you are... What's the word?
3589.607,3590.407,What am I trying to say?
3590.587,3590.888,Awesome?
3591.088,3591.168,No.
3591.208,3592.248,Is the word you're trying to say awesome?
3592.708,3604.394,"Your opinion... You are taking The Kids Are Alright at face value, I think, and that's why you don't like it, and I think that's kind of an insult to a film that's much more deeper than its face value."
3607.121,3618.67, I think your criticisms have to do with the idea that you think... I think your interpretation of the film is that the filmmaker believes the things that are said by the characters.
3619.251,3624.494,And that bothers me.
3624.635,3627.817,"When you say believe the things that they say, what do you mean?"
3628.277,3633.401,I remember one of your biggest problems was Julianne Moore's...
3635.747,3638.069, Sort of speech of now.
3638.109,3658.205,"I don't even know what it's not really an apology But I don't want to spoil I guess for what happens, but you know, you know the big yeah She has to Annette Bening and you said like a speech of reconciliation at the very least Yeah, and you said it was a cheap reconciliation or something like that that it was I'm trying to think what the word is that you that you used trite or something like that and"
3658.385,3659.506, I also don't think it was well-written.
3660.546,3662.107,But I think that's what I'm saying.
3662.187,3663.768,I think it was well-written.
3664.088,3675.393,"I think Julianne Moore's character is just supposed to be not very well-spoken and is supposed to be being slightly dishonest with herself, even if she wouldn't admit it in that scene."
3675.413,3679.575,I think there's more going on in that scene than you're giving the scene credit for.
3679.895,3681.436,And that's why it bothers me when you say it's awful.
3681.476,3681.976,So here we are.
3685.758,3689.221," Um, you know, one of us is clearly right and one of us is not."
3689.481,3691.543,"Um, see, and I'm not saying which is which."
3692.323,3710.456,"Um, but, uh, that's the thing is I'm, I'm perfectly like willing to be flexible on some, on, on all movies, but what's, I think, I think maybe five years ago I might have like a, just a knee jerk negative reaction"
3711.454,3716.482, to even the very fact that you're calling into question my intelligence.
3726.744,3732.188," And my, and my instinct, even my instinct now is a little bit to be like, well, yes, but here's the thing."
3732.208,3735.871,I'm not saying well-written like she should deliver a fricking patent-like monologue.
3735.911,3736.752,That's not what I mean.
3737.132,3738.474,"I mean, it's not well-written."
3738.874,3741.136,I don't think that fits her character.
3741.716,3743.518,If you want to say she's being dishonest with herself.
3743.538,3746.04,"I think she's being dishonest in the, yeah."
3746.14,3747.621,And that's why it comes across as straight.
3747.821,3751.904,"I would buy that way more than, than anything else."
3752.565,3752.785,And.
3754.607,3756.148,But I think she believes she's being honest.
3757.807,3769.444, Have you ever been in an argument with a boyfriend or girlfriend or wife and sort of maybe convinced yourself that you believed the thing that you thought would make the best argument?
3770.225,3771.006,I'm sure I've done it.
3771.807,3772.709,"I'm sure I probably have, yeah."
3775.12,3777.962," And that's the thing, make a best argument, yes."
3779.363,3783.646,It very seldom has happened with me when it comes to an apology.
3783.686,3785.328,The apology is usually sincere.
3786.168,3789.651,And I think this goes to what I was saying.
3789.711,3792.313,I brought up Avatar and I brought up Kids Are Alright.
3792.333,3793.414,There's a reason I bring those up.
3793.794,3794.194,"And by the way,"
3796.856,3802.059," I will be lumping the film Hugo in with this, which you haven't seen."
3802.119,3805.34,"That's why, listeners, I'm sure you love that movie, and I'm sorry."
3805.961,3813.704,"But there is one aspect that dazzles people so much, and that's because it is dazzling."
3814.225,3814.525,The three D?
3816.21,3816.791," Yeah, kinda."
3817.431,3832.484,"Although I didn't see Hugo in three-D, but I saw Avatar in three-D, and I think visually it's a dazzling film, and I think the three-D is done very well, and I think that it's done so well that it distracts people from a bad story, and that's the thing."
3834.758,3863.372, I was gonna argue okay and I think some people say like and some people would say like but it's not about the story it's like okay well someone should tell James Cameron that because he's telling a story and telling it poorly and then but in the same way like kids are alright I think the so avatar you've got special effects and all of that and I don't mean to sound dismissive that it's great he really creates a whole other world whereas kids are alright I think it's the acting if you were to read the lines on the page
3864.853,3884.89, kids are all right now of course I okay let me finish that thought if you were to read the pay the words on the page of kids are I think you'd be like this is not good is this a first draft I think the actors elevated and Julianne Moore in that moment is great I think any idea of I think any any any idea of her
3888.832,3894.074," dishonesty, whether she's aware of it or not, I think that's purely a function of her."
3894.494,3898.796,"Now, of course, one could say it's also the function of the director giving her that note to play."
3899.156,3907.779,"But part of me is like, I try not to emphasize the script as much as I used to when I was younger and maybe even when we started this podcast."
3909.64,3913.021,"But when a film is that, that type of film,"
3913.965,3921.114, then I feel like the script needs to be better than four or five separate instances of somebody saying fuck you and leaving and that's the end of the scene.
3921.615,3929.044,"Like, like either that is John Cassavetes level realism"
3930.726,3932.327, Or it's lazy writing.
3933.168,3936.531,And that film is not John Cassavetes level realism.
3936.971,3942.275,"Because in reality, as you were saying, her apology isn't worded perfectly."
3942.715,3943.396,And that's great.
3943.956,3944.577,That's a good thing.
3944.977,3948.64,They should continue with that.
3949.2,3950.141,And it fits with her character.
3953.473,3953.894, But I don't know.
3954.855,3966.31,"But the film, there's enough moments of contrivance in the script that makes me question the moments where it's like, if this were a better script, I think I'd give that line more"
3967.785,3990.412, credibility but because there's so much other stuff where it's just like oh really she goes searching and finds hair in the brush and oh that's a it's a reference to something that happened earlier in the script and okay oh and they're talking about like oh we can't do this again oh smash cut to that they just did it
3991.432,3992.193, Wah-wah.
3992.593,3998.096,"Like, moments like that are, to me, what... That moment is not played for comedy, in my opinion."
3998.676,4003.179,"If it were played like the wah-wah, like you're saying, that would be hackneyed."
4003.479,4005.36,I think it very much plays it for that.
4005.48,4007.461,And their sex scenes in general are played for that.
4008.522,4013.324,"They're more goofy than they are, uh... Not goofy, but they're comical and exaggerated."
4014.905,4015.545,Do you think so?
4015.686,4019.588,"I think they're, like, sort of... You know what, maybe we're having different kinds of sex."
4021.917,4026.798," I thought they were, I mean, they were definitely exuberant, but I thought there was a, uh, honesty to them."
4027.058,4028.658,"But I want to talk about, I want to talk about Avatar for a second."
4028.678,4028.818,Okay.
4029.479,4049.863,"Because, and, and bring it back to the general topic, that you and I have become more, because we, uh, went in with this almost unstated, like, mission statement you were talking about earlier, that it's okay for both of us to be right, we've been able to, um, develop the things that we care about in film and bring them, uh, to, uh,"
4051.303,4074.874, to the discussions and that's why whereas with the kids are all right there's a part of me that will probably never stop trying to convince you that it's a great movie and i'll probably do the opposite but with avatar i totally understand everything you yeah but i still actually really like avatar it was one of my top ten movies the year and i stand by that um even though i yes uh there's some
4076.275,4095.427, intellectually dodgy stuff in it and also the dialogue is bad but when you say he's not telling the story well well when you say people say it's not about the story i don't think that's quite right he does develop a world but it is still about the story when you say he's telling it not telling it well what you mean is he's not telling it well with the words
4096.568,4111.962," And I agree with you, but I think with the images which is something that I as you know a formalist I'm not completely putting myself in that corner, but it is something that I value In a structuralist that's my new thing"
4112.603,4127.942, um that's my new i think i said that last week didn't i think so um i i think it is that um avatar visually is still more than the sum of its parts it's not just a great uh um
4128.903,4156.351, world that he's created it has propulsive forward momentum and taps into some primal desires about you know uh... loving and dreaming and flying and freedom and all that kind of hokey stuff but uh... it goes back to the earnestness thing that we talked about last week james cameron means it and i think when you get into the more specifically worded allegories uh...
4158.912,4185.394, he is forcing it a little bit more than the other stuff which uh... uh... i think is more important to him even if he maybe wouldn't read he might see it insists or represented insisted it said this allegory about the environment right and you know uh... take care of the and the environment and native peoples and stuff like that but that's the thing thing i believe once a film is made then
4186.875,4199.377, whatever the director says is the point of it isn't i agree uh no it's only irrelevant i'm talking about the film i'm talking about what the director said it's ours now yeah it is in a way ours now um so uh
4200.945,4220.906, when I say that the the environment that the clumsy environment allegory is a minor background misstep for avatar I believe that and I believe that it can be true for me because that's the way I watched and that's the way I experienced it and I think that
4223.188,4237.099," For me, he is trying to use the effects as a way of almost Trojan-horsing something that he... I mean, that is not a B story, nor is it even a B theme."
4237.579,4239.14,"I mean, that is forefront."
4239.22,4240.161,That is right there.
4240.421,4244.324,"And when I say he tells the story poorly, I don't merely mean in the words."
4244.424,4245.845,I mean in character archetype.
4246.206,4247.707,I mean in structure of the story.
4250.008,4253.35," And here's the thing, he is a strong visual filmmaker."
4253.65,4260.352,"When the giant tree comes down and ash is raining down, I mean, we all know what that is."
4260.372,4262.713,"I mean, we all know what that seems like."
4262.913,4276.679,"Before we get too far afield here, this is what I'm talking about, that you and I, because the idea of story structure and character arcs and archetypes is higher on the priority list for you, it's gonna rub you more the wrong way."
4276.699,4278.26,"And this is what we're talking about, we can both be right."
4280.669,4289.873," But to me, it's almost like if the film was going to do what you said, part of me is like, man, I wish it had liberated itself from the idea of a story."
4289.993,4293.235,"I wish that it had been more... I mean, I brought up Tree of Life earlier."
4293.255,4299.118,"I wish that it had just been like, we have characters, we have a story,"
4300.057,4310.627, it is the loosest possible thing and we are going to go off on a flight of fancy and just have it be a film all about discovery without having to make it about this other thing.
4310.727,4314.371,"It's almost like, oh Cameron, didn't you realize what you had before you ruined it?"
4314.911,4315.091,Yeah.
4315.472,4318.454,"I don't think he's ever going to be, James Cameron is not an impressionist."
4318.494,4320.156,He's never going to be able to do that.
4320.996,4326.498," Although, I do wonder if someday the technology will advance to the place where you can create a world like, what's it called?"
4326.518,4327.018,Pandora.
4327.078,4327.918,"Pandora, yeah."
4328.078,4330.439,And then just have an improvisational film within it.
4330.779,4331.88,Wouldn't that be wonderful?
4331.96,4334.941,"Because of the way the technology works right now, obviously you have to- Yeah."
4335.201,4337.982,Everything needs to be worked out almost years in advance.
4338.222,4338.862,Yeah.
4339.182,4341.503,"But yeah, that would be wonderful if you could just do things like-"
4342.863,4362.496, i mean that the part my favorite part of avatar is when they tame and then fly the uh... dragons at first that that that first scene uh... it's because it's there are things said in the scene that aren't important at all the scene is totally just about uh... action and movement uh...
4364.697,4384.994," Yeah, I honestly if it had more sort of stuff like that experiencing these Emotions of like new discovery of a new world and new possibilities with your mind and body Which is what was important to me about it if you could have an improvisational tree-of-life type film But with the kind of kineticism no avatar whereas tree of life is a little more elegaic."
4385.354,4386.675,Is that how you that's a word?
4386.715,4391.339,I only read elegiac Because it would be elegy so probably elegiac.
4391.359,4393.2,I don't know anyway
4396.022,4424.799, uh... that would be a better way that film that like uh... it hyper connect but still impressionist version of avatar that i mentioned i had right now is amazing and that's what that's what i would really like to see and and this brings uh... i want to have this bring us back to what we're talking about which is the uh... the ways in which we've changed i honestly believe that five years ago if we were to have this discussion i think i would dismiss avatars terrible which by the way i have
4426.36,4438.846, on more than one lesson when I was left to my own devices and talked about it for an hour and By the end of it wound up going maybe a little too extreme But I don't think I've listened to that one Give it a listen.
4438.986,4442.508,It's a Little rough enough to that.
4442.668,4450.272,I wrote a wrote an apology and then apologized in the next episode as well Because I tend to listen to anything where you discuss movie I've seen
4451.252,4470.199, it's i stand by all the points but my general tone was a little too discussive uh by the way i know i know i've brought this up before um and i don't want to embarrass you but uh people should listen to your toy story three episode okay if they you know people tell you know there are many different ways critically to approach
4472.04,4478.923," a film, you know, formalist, structuralist, but also based on your belief system, feminist, politically, they're all valid."
4479.263,4491.409,"And if you are some sort of, like, too-cool-for-school-hip guy who doesn't think that a Christian approach to interpreting film can be helpful, listen to the Toy Story three episode."
4491.969,4504.419," Because it is a fantastic and fascinating way of looking at that film that I think, even if you're not a Christian, would help you understand or have a new way of understanding the way the story is told and what the parable is."
4504.879,4505.379,"Aw, shucks."
4506.941,4508.942,"I'm pretty sure I've done that before, because I love that episode."
4509.022,4511.244,"I think so, yes, and I appreciate it every time."
4515.982,4544.402, so is so yes with with my avatar so i think i went a little off the rails but i was able i didn't stand by that i said but i stand by the points absolutely my general tone five years ago i'd be like yeah it's awful you know like and i think i think as you get older i just in general but i think again and then that's why you and i would get into a fight about whether mentor was better than the whole drive and i throw a bowl of popcorn and i don't know if it was better but just
4546.306,4574.145, just which one deserved to be nominated for more independent spirit awards literally that's what the argument was yeah and i started still more on drive in my opinion but that's and and the argument that i was making at the time though i did not make it um uh fully it was that independent spirit awards it's the it's an award show just like every other yeah just because it claims to trumpet this thing doesn't mean it's gonna usually it's it's like okay what independent film made the most money
4574.685,4603.895, got it yeah um and so like how do you define independent i mean exactly the the nominations come out this year no they wouldn't know yet but uh oh wait maybe they have stuff like tree of life and take shelter two of my favorite movies of the year can you you know fox searchlight and sony pictures classics can you really call them independent i mean they cost a lot of money yeah and were released by studios even if it was the quote-unquote indie wing
4604.395,4607.117," And again, those are my two of my favorite films of the year."
4607.697,4613.361,"Yeah, I had a friend who submitted a film to Sundance, and he's like, he goes, I don't think it'll be accepted, it's too small."
4613.421,4618.204,"It's like, yeah, I feel like maybe Sundance has moved away from its roots when you say the film is too small."
4618.244,4621.386,I guess that's what Slamdance is for now.
4621.626,4632.734,"So I think as you get older, but also because, to repeat what I was saying earlier, the fact that we have to talk about movies for an hour once a week with each other"
4634.122,4641.488," And so there's a sense of history of like, yeah, I can't let you get away with, not even so much I can't let you get away with it, just like, well, I know you."
4642.189,4648.253,"And so like, I know enough about you to be able to follow up with that at the very least from a personal level."
4649.755,4654.639,"But then also just having listeners and that degree of accountability, knowing full well that you could get emails back."
4655.039,4662.245,"I think it requires, I think it inspires a sense of nuance and realizing not only is there one other point of view that I'm talking to, but"
4663.846,4679.133," you know, hundreds, if not thousands of people that will email me and say, I agree, but for a completely different reason, or I disagree, but I still see what you're saying, which is basically what you say, which is like, you can see pretty much all my points about avatar."
4679.213,4679.373,Yeah.
4679.593,4680.134,And the kids are all right.
4680.434,4682.214,"But, um, no, I'm joking about that."
4682.695,4686.757,"Uh, you can see all those, but you say, but that's not what the film I think is about."
4686.777,4688.237,"And it's like, Oh, all right."
4689.058,4689.518,I think it is.
4691.445,4697.008," And I think years ago I would have been like, well, clearly this is what it's about."
4697.828,4715.837,"And so I think nuance hopefully comes with age, but also the nature of podcasting, the accountability that comes from it, the responsibility to, okay, sorry about where I'm headed, to be something of a role model."
4716.843,4727.895, okay in that we've gotten a fair number of of emails from surprisingly young listeners right fourteen fifteen that astounds me and by the way some of them
4729.318,4731.359," like, say, like, hey, I write reviews, too."
4731.7,4732.26,Here's one.
4732.36,4734.582,"And I read them like, oh, jeez, I've wasted my life."
4734.622,4738.124,This fourteen year old writes way more eloquently than I ever will.
4738.584,4743.748,"But so that's that's to say, like, it's not like I'm some kind of wise old man."
4744.228,4751.373,"But but, you know, when you have I remember back to when I was fourteen and fifteen and I didn't have anything like this."
4752.053,4755.716,I only had me and my friends and what I had and just films.
4756.296,4758.157,And there's nothing necessarily wrong with that.
4758.618,4758.798,But
4760.822,4766.394," Knowing that we have an audience that is sometimes younger is like, well, okay, I shouldn't be."
4767.461,4768.101, an asshole.
4769.201,4783.045,"If I aspire to changing the tone, which of course I don't aspire to that anymore, some delusions of grandeur there, but if that's something that I ever aspire to, then it's like, well, I need to be the one to change it."
4783.265,4784.385,I need to change my tone.
4784.805,4790.307,"And yes, I do realize I said fuck you to the listeners earlier, but not to the actual listeners, to some vague idea"
4791.127,4811.722, i'm glad you were clear though about what you meant that there are people there are listeners to whom we are role models because they've told us as much yes we don't behave as if we're role models to everyone listening i never said i was a role model david that's what celebrities say um when they do something wrong by the way i just i just wanted to clarify that we don't think that we're
4812.643,4815.144, necessarily instructive to everyone who's listening.
4815.224,4815.365,Right.
4815.445,4822.909,"No, I only say that because younger people have said like, oh, I, you know, I, I found this show and it was like, and it's like, really?"
4822.969,4824.269,That's okay.
4824.509,4837.877,"This has gone way longer than I wanted to, but there's one, uh, recent thing that I've been working on that the show and, and criticism and stuff has helped me with, but I don't even know that I'm still all the way there."
4839.057,4866.937, which is really learning to and this is a fake it before you make it take it until you make it type of thing because I do try to do this but really learning to treat to treat highbrow middlebrow and lowbrow film all as film first and not put them necessarily in in in boxes in such a way that I'll judge them by different standards
4870.276,4883.686, you know lowbrow and middlebrow art is just as vital as as highbrow maybe if you even look at the depth whatever the definition of vital means lowbrow might be the most vital
4887.236,4893.842," Uh, you know, and middle brow wins the most awards and highbrow stuff, I think maybe is the kind of stuff that doesn't get recognized."
4893.922,4895.043,It's too damn good for awards.
4895.144,4901.249,"I think, no, I think it's the kind of stuff that doesn't get widely recognized till later, if at all."
4901.57,4901.73,Yeah.
4902.35,4909.277,"Uh, but in any way, just trying, trying to not like make any."
4910.931,4933.609, excuses but for for lowbrow maybe that's why but and again you liked real steel i i i didn't hate real steel but i think a lot of people liked it more than i did and i think maybe part of that is because um there were some concessions made like just saying oh it's only trying to be this
4934.329,4935.089, Right.
4935.689,4943.732,"I'm not even sure if I would say I liked it, liked it, more just pleasantly surprised, which is kind of far."
4943.892,4946.533,"It's somewhat far from liking it, but there are parts of it that I like."
4946.913,4949.834,"And, you know, it's interesting to go along with what you're saying."
4950.914,4955.975,"The way you even phrased it, I think, denotes something, a change in you and I think in me."
4956.736,4959.916,"You say like lowbrow, middlebrown, highbrow art."
4959.936,4961.077,"You know, I'm trying to approach that."
4961.597,4961.697,OK.
4963.197,4967.326," Years ago, I think, I won't speak for you, but I'll speak for me."
4968.345,4969.086, Lowbrow is an art.
4969.886,4975.57,"You know, I mean, it's, it's literally that it's that much, just the very fact that you're saying all three of them are art."
4975.69,4976.651,That's not the question.
4977.251,4978.792,"The question is, what do we value?"
4978.892,4980.793,How do we individually value each one?
4981.374,4991.36,"And so, whereas I think years ago when I was younger and I perhaps a bit more brash, um, I think I would have, there's entire genres of film and okay."
4992.581,4993.222,Epic movie.
4993.642,4997.685,I'm not sure if I would consider that art simply because it is such a financial calculation.
4998.285,4998.75, Thank you.
4999.278,5002.24," And even that, I'm a little iffy on just saying that."
5002.921,5004.442,I could say it's bad art.
5005.223,5007.144,It is unrealized potential.
5007.644,5008.765,I could say any number of things.
5009.986,5013.949,"But years ago, I definitely would have said, like, this film is art, this film is not."
5013.989,5015.63,Real still is not art.
5016.471,5018.032,"Like, I would have said that ten years ago."
5018.572,5019.954,I might have even said it five years ago.
5020.534,5028.58,And so I think that attitude is really one of the best ones that
5030.106,5040.97," that any, that a film critic certainly, but any film student should have, which is be looking to, be looking to accept more than, you know, reject."
5042.011,5042.191,Yeah.
5042.931,5046.072,"And I think a good, a music example is helpful."
5046.092,5055.556,Keep in mind that the Ramones were a lowbrow act that were also at the forefront of one of the most important musical artistic movements of the twentieth century.
5057.517,5058.597,"And it's, yeah, it's,"
5061.252,5066.117," Critics have gotten a bad rap, and that is often as a function of critics, of what we want to do."
5066.157,5077.068,"I think there might be some, I don't think this is the case for all of them, maybe even some of them, I think in the minority, there are some that maybe aspired to certain things, as you and I did when we moved out here."
5078.169,5079.41, And then that didn't happen.
5079.631,5084.495,"And there does seem to be, for some, a general idea of like, well, screw them."
5085.316,5090.261,"You know, like I worked enough to know how a film should be and all that sort of thing."
5090.621,5095.886,"And I think, but I think that stigma has been attached to pretty much all critics."
5095.906,5102.573,"And I think the best way to, to deflect that,"
5104.23,5110.593, is to show that you are willing to go anywhere a film takes you.
5111.313,5124.538,"Now, whether the film works for you or whether the film achieves what you think it's trying to achieve, not even necessarily what the filmmaker's trying to achieve, but where the film is headed, whether it actually arrives there or not, that's up to you to decide."
5124.578,5126.819,"And if you think a film is bad, then by all means say it's bad."
5127.559,5139.302," But, but to, and we've said this a million times, to be willing to meet the film where it is at rather than require that it meets you in the one place, by the way, where you are."
5140.123,5148.665,"I think that's, I think that is the biggest thing that I've gotten out of being a film student in general, but doing this podcast."
5149.079,5172.888, yeah the the other podcast and the internet in general and the thing i was talking about like having blinders on to the rest of the podcasting world taking those off has been a big help and seeing things uh... there's a lot of a lot of internet from criticism wholly embraces uh... lowbrow art uh... lowbrow cinema uh... and i think that's fantastic you know uh... i think as i think a lot of the uh...
5174.329,5183.437," I certainly think the Sam Raimi super, or Spider-Man rather, movies would be considered lowbrow, but I mean that in the best way."
5183.497,5190.863,Whereas maybe Christian Bale's Batman stuff is a bit more middlebrow because it quote-unquote takes itself more seriously.
5190.883,5192.345,You won't even say it's Christopher Nolans.
5193.306,5214.465, uh did i what did i say christian bales oh yeah i meant christopher nolan so it's weird that i would do that yeah i always try to say the director um but i i can't remember if it was on my list when we did our top ten of the decade but nonetheless one of my favorite films of the past decade the previous decade was bong joon-ho's the host i don't think it was on your top ten
5214.685,5234.014, okay um but i do think that's an outstanding and stellar film but i also think that ten years ago maybe even five but probably yeah maybe five but definitely ten years ago i would have said yes that was a fun movie but i would have serious yeah and probably more middle ground
5238.171,5239.212," Yeah, probably."
5239.652,5242.094,"Yeah, because we have an idea of what we're supposed to be."
5243.315,5250.181,"And then you realize, and I think this is a good thing about the internet in general, is you realize there are so many opinions out there."
5251.362,5254.665,Supposed to doesn't really mean much anymore.
5255.286,5257.367,And so just be what you are.
5259.449,5262.312," I think that's – I don't mean to say like, hey, kids, be what you are."
5262.753,5265.997,"But just for me, that is kind of what has come about."
5266.037,5275.107,"I mean as I said, I wrote a blog recently about this feeling like being a fraud because I'm not this thing and trying desperately to reject this notion of"
5275.848,5282.933," trying to be what I think a critic, like this image of a critic, as opposed to, well, what's the critic I'm going to be?"
5283.813,5284.354,Who's that?
5284.894,5297.002,"And I think doing, to go back to what we were talking about earlier, on a personal level, this podcast has really helped to shape what I want to be as a critic and what we want this show to be, of course."
5297.562,5298.523,"And so, yeah."
5299.023,5299.824," Well, you know what I want to be?"
5300.084,5300.324,What's that?
5300.624,5301.785,"At home asleep, because I'm sick."
5301.925,5302.265,Fair enough.
5302.446,5303.726,So let's wrap this up.
5304.327,5308.25,"I do want to end on one schmaltzy, super sappy note."
5308.71,5309.09,All right.
5309.25,5315.555,"Back on episode of Fifty-Two, if you'll recall, we were just about, it was our, obviously that's a one-year anniversary."
5315.875,5316.335,Sure was.
5316.355,5324.161,"And we were just about ready to wrap up, and then you interjected to say something really nice about me, about how you didn't want, you wouldn't have wanted to do the podcast without me."
5324.601,5326.502,"And it's, I know it's been... Did I say that?"
5326.743,5326.903,Yeah.
5327.523,5330.644," It's been like four years since that, but it really stuck with me."
5330.724,5344.827,"So I wanted to say that not only do I echo that sentiment, that there's no one else I'd want to do this podcast with, I also want to add that if I had started doing this podcast with someone else, I wouldn't still be doing it now."
5345.367,5349.568,The only person I want to do this podcast with for five years and for five years to come is you.
5350.649,5351.089,"Thank you, David."
